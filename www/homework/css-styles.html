 <h3>Latest news</h3>
   <p>Around midnight on September 22,1989, Hurricane Hugo roared ashore just north of Charleston, S.C. as a massive Category 4 storm with winds near 140 mph and a storm tide around 20 feet. The hurricane leveled beachfront properties and toppled trees, leaving much of the coastal areas in absolute ruin.</p>
   <p>Hugo remained strong as it moved into western North Carolina, producing hurricane-force wind gusts all the way to Charlotte. Thirteen people in South Carolina and one person in North Carolina died as a result of the storm (as well as six in Virginia and one in New York). Hurricane Hugo caused 7 billion in damage in the U.S. mainland, making it the costliest hurricane at the time. When adjusted for inflation, it currently ranks as the ninth most costly hurricane in U.S. history, causing almost 13 billion in damage.</p>
   <p>To commemorate this historic storm, the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Charleston, S.C. created a website which features a video series that looks back at what it was like before, during and after the storm, as well as a look at the future of hurricane forecasting and forecast communication challenges. The videos include interviews with local officials, media, National Hurricane Center meteorologists and the director of the National Weather Service, Louis Uccellini. In addition, there is an interactive map developed by Coastal Services Center that shows the stormâ€™s path and impacts, including storm surge.</p>
